# Description

https://github.com/davidmarble/cookbooks

This repository is all the cookbooks that I currently use or need to maintain 
for various projects. Those that have been forked from Opscode or others and 
those that warrant a separate repo are included as submodules.

To clone with all submodules, use `git clone --recursive`. If you already have some submodules and need to add more recursively, use `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
